      Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph (Founders of Netflix): As a small company that turned into a billion
      dollar company, Elisha's web development skills really helped us get to where we are. We had an idea but 
      we needed help executing and creating a website that would be appealing to our subscribers. After having Elisha 
      come in and create a website for us, our company took off. We gained millions of subcribers and 
      they all said how easy it was to navigate our site and find their favorite shows and movies. Elisha is a great 
      web developer and we would definitely recommend him to others.

      coming in and making headlines it is very important that all of it is organized in an orderly fashion
